<h2 align="center"> About Me ✨ </h2>
  
<h5 font-size=5rem> 🙋🏼‍♀️  I'm a front-end development student from Colombia, who loves programming and learning as much as I can.</h5>
  
🚀  After graduating as a designer and working in the area, I felt curious about the development which captivated me from the beginning, starting with courses and now with technology.
  
🛠  I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Figma, Adobe (Illustrator|Potoshop|Adobe xd) Scrum. I'm learning React , Angular, MySQL but I'm open to learning any other technology!
  
🎨  I am a highly creative person. I love generating attractive experiences, not only visually but also functionally, paying special attention on details. I like being part of a team because I can learn from my teammates and bring my knowledge in order to achieve goals.
