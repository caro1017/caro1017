<h2> About Me ✨ </h2>

<h6>🙋🏼‍♀️  I'm a front-end development student from Colombia, who loves programming and learning as much as I can.</h6>
  
<h6>🚀  After graduating as a designer and working in the area, I felt curious about the development which captivated me from the beginning, starting with courses and now with technology.</h6>
  
<h6>🛠  I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Figma, Adobe (Illustrator|Potoshop|Adobe xd) Scrum. I'm learning React , Angular, MySQL but I'm open to learning any other technology!</h6>
  
<h6>🎨  I am a highly creative person. I love generating attractive experiences, not only visually but also functionally, paying special attention on details. I like being part of a team because I can learn from my teammates and bring my knowledge in order to achieve goals.</h6>
